##  Overview
Conducted a deep-dive analysis of product review data from Daraz to uncover insights on customer sentiment, product quality feedback, and category-level trends. This analysis supports customer-centric strategy development.

##  Business Problem
How can customer feedback be systematically analyzed to improve product quality, customer satisfaction, and marketing effectiveness?

##  Data & Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset: CSV file of product reviews scraped from Daraz

##  Methods Used
- Data cleaning and preparation (null handling, formatting)
- Text analysis of review content
- Sentiment proxies via word frequency and rating correlation
- Visualizations: histograms, bar plots, word clouds

##  Key Insights
- Certain categories (electronics, fashion) had the highest review volumes
- Common customer concerns included delivery speed and product authenticity
- Frequent keywords: “good”, “original”, “fast”, “damaged”

##  Skills Demonstrated
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Customer sentiment extraction from textual data
- Business framing of technical output

##  Outcome
The project provided a scalable approach to reviewing large-scale customer feedback for operational improvement. Insights can guide vendor vetting, marketing communication, and customer support enhancement.
